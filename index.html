                            <p class="text-white">Some people would like to do their reading, but are physically unable
                                to hold a book or turn a page. Our aim is to create an accessory that removes strain off
                                users with hand or arm impairments, ultimately improving accessibility for physical
                                books.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-white mt-4">Target Domain</h2>

                            <p class="text-white">According to an article by Vinesh Janarthanan, Assad-Uz-Zaman, and
                                Mohammad Habibur Rahman, It is estimated that ‚Äúmore than 3 million [United States
                                residents] have a disability‚Äù in their hands or arms due to reasons including
                                ‚Äúparalyzations [and] orthopedic impairments, either congenital or injury related.‚Äù

                                Our goal is to create a way for people with hand and arm disabilities to read a book
                                with ease, and flip through pages without issues. Our idea is to create a page turner
                                that is operated with a foot pedal.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-white mt-4">User Scenarios</h2>

                            <p class="text-white">Grandma Sue has crippling rheumatoid arthritis and has limited finger
                                mobility. As someone with chronic pain, Grandma Sue is unable to use either of her hands
                                with ease, making reading difficult.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-white">Benson broke his arm at football practice and isn‚Äôt able to do his
                                reading annotations for school easily. With the hands-free page turner, he is able to
                                complete his chapter readings and notes before the due date.
                            </p>

                    <h2 class="text-white mt-4">User Study Results</h2>

                    <p class="text-white">User Study Method: We are making participants mimic specific
                        disabilities or injuries, as well as multi-tasking scenarios detailed in the previous
                        constraint ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">Rationale for Method: This method ensures that the users actually test
                        the high-fidelity prototype in a very similar manner as the target demographic before
                        providing an opinion as to the efficacy of the product.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">Participants: Participants are put in a scenario or constraint that
                        strongly resembles the disabilities of the target demographic.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">Recruiting: We gather participants from the Zachry Engineering Center
                        to see our demonstration and answer questions after using the prototype.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mt-4">Findings and Insights</h3>

                    <p class="text-white">After surveying testing participants, participants found using the
                        pedal rather than their hands to turn the page much simpler, encouraging them to
                        continue their assignments and hobbies. Participants said given their restrictions, they
                        would continue use. Participants suggested that the prototype be more stable to support
                        different kinds of books. Overall the product was successful.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="text-white mt-4">Analysis</h3>

                    <p class="text-white">The consistently high ratings across categories tested (including
                        versatility, likelihood of use, stability, idea rating, and ease of use) indicate that
                        the hands free page turner provides excellent user satisfaction.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">1. Versatile: Users found the page turner (having a versatility score
                        of 8.27) beneficial for multiple scenarios, not limited to physical disabilities but
                        also helpful for multitasking and temporary injuries.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">2. Likelihood of Use: having a versatility score of 7.54 indicates
                        that users perceive our product as something they are inclined to use frequently or
                        regularly when reading a book.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">3. Stability: The stability score of 5.9 is our biggest concern, which
                        is something to be improved upon in future iterations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">4. Idea Rating: A high idea rating of 9.27 suggests that users find
                        the product innovative or novel, and prefer the foot pedals to other alternatives
                        presented in the background research section.</p>
                    <p class="text-white">5. Ease of Use: rating of 7.64 reflects the user-friendliness of our
                        product, indicating that it is intuitive and accessible, thereby reducing barriers to
                        adoption. </p>
                    <p class="text-white">Overall, these high scores demonstrate that the product not only meets
                        but exceeds user expectations across key metrics</p>

                    <h1 class="text-white mb-4">Conclusion & Future Work</h1>
                    <p class="text-white">In conclusion, the user study clearly illustrates the benefit of the product and its usability for making reading physical books more accessible. However, the user study highlights a clear preference among users for a more stable product.  Moving forward, future work should focus on refining the design to ensure utmost stability, perhaps building with sturdier materials. Additionally, a comprehensive cost analysis would greatly benefit users regarding the affordability and scalability of the product. Balancing functionality with cost-effectiveness By addressing these aspects, the hands-free page turner can advance the inclusivity of reading experiences for individuals with diverse needs.</p>
